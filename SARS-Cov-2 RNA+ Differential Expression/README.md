In order to test the genes and pathways associated with the presence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA, we used the following approach to account for the biases due to differences in number of nuclei, quality and sample-to-sample variability. First, we only considered cell types with at least 10 SARS-Cov-2 RNA+ nuclei (above ambient levels) and within a given cell type we only considered samples with at least 2 SARS-Cov-2 RNA+ nuclei. Then we subsampled the SARS-Cov-2 RNA- nuclei to match the complexity distributions. The nuclei were partitioned into 5 bins based on complexity, log10(Number of genes/nuclei), and the SARS-Cov-2 RNA- nuclei were subsampled to match the distribution of the SARS-Cov-2 RNA+ nuclei [9]. We resampled the pool of SARS-Cov-2 RNA- nuclei to generate the null distribution for the mean expression and the pathway scores in order to estimate an empirical p-value for the mean expression in the SAR-Cov-2 RNA+ nuclei. Mean expression was calculated by normalizing the UMI counts using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) normalization [113] and adjusted for batch effects using limma’s removeBatchEffect function. Pathway scores were estimated for the selected nuclei and then adjusted for batch effects using limma’s removeBatchEffect function. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using FDR.
