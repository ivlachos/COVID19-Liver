We adapted methods [97,118,119] previously described in [7] to designate a single nucleus as SARS-CoV-2 RNA+ or SARS-CoV-2 RNA-. A permutation test was utilized to determine the probability that the nucleus contained a higher SARS-Cov-2 UMI content than expected by ambient contamination, while taking into account the fractional abundance of SARS-Cov-2 aligning UMIs, the abundance of SARS-Cov-2 aligning UMIs in the ambient pool, and the estimated ambient contamination of the single nucleus.

The fractional abundance of SARS-Cov-2 aligning UMIs per nucleus was defined as the number of UMIs assigned to all viral genomic features divided by the total number of UMIs aligning to either the SARS-Cov-2 or GRCh38 reference. The abundance of SARS-Cov-2 UMIs in the ambient pool was defined as the sum of all SARS-Cov-2 UMIs in the pre-CellBender output within discarded nuclei flagged as “empty” or “low quality”. Hence, the ambient fractional abundance was determined for each sample independently. The discarded nuclei were resampled to generate the null distribution of the SARS-CoV-2 fractional abundance, which was utilized to extract empirical p-values for the observed fractional abundance of each nucleus. The empirical p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rate. Nuclei with at least 2 SARS-Cov-2 UMIs and an FDR < 0.05 were assigned as “SARS-CoV-2 RNA+”; “SARS-Cov-2 Ambient” if having SARS-CoV-2 UMIs but were not significantly higher than the ambient pool; and “SARS-CoV-2 RNA-” if no SARS-Cov-2 UMIs were detected.
